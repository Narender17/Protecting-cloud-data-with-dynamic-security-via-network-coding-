# Protecting cloud data with dynamic security via network coding
This project focuses on keeping cloud data safe using a smart and flexible security method called network coding. Instead of just locking the data with passwords or encryption, we break it into pieces, mix it in a special way, and send it across different paths. This makes it harder for hackers to steal or damage the data. Even if some parts are lost or attacked, we can still recover the original data. Itâ€™s a modern and powerful way to protect information in the cloud.
# Overview
- Focuses on securing cloud data using dynamic security techniques.
- Implements network coding, which breaks data into parts and mixes them for safe transmission.
- Enhances protection by sending coded data through multiple network paths, making it harder for attackers to intercept or corrupt.
- Ensures data recovery even if some parts are lost or compromised.
- Goes beyond traditional encryption methods to offer real-time, reliable, and flexible cloud security.
- Aims to create a secure and efficient system for storing and transmitting sensitive data in the cloud.
